# AVANT - FULL-STACK

This is a Full-stack e-commerce web application

The goal was to build an authentication system using React and JWT on the client side and Express on the server side. The process of building this system involved several steps, including setting up the client and server, creating the necessary routes and functions, and implementing the use of JWT.
