# AVANT - FULL-STACK

This is a Full-stack e-commerce web application

The goal was to build an authentication system using React and JWT on the client side and Express on the server side. The process of building this system involved several steps, including setting up the client and server, creating the necessary routes and functions, and implementing the use of JWT.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Implementing JWT authentication: To solve this, I used the jsonwebtoken library to handle the generation and verification of tokens on the server side and the use of tokens for authenticated requests on the client side.

- Error handling: Another challenge I faced was handling errors properly. This involved understanding how to properly handle errors on both the client and server side. I had to ensure that the system would handle errors in a way that was user-friendly and provided meaningful feedback to the user. I also had to ensure that the system would not break if an error occurred. To overcome this challenge, I made sure to properly test the system and added error handling code in the necessary areas.

- Implementing User Info Changes: When building the feature that allowed users to change their information, I initially ran into a problem where I was creating a new object instead of updating the existing user object. To resolve this, I first verified that the user was changing the correct account information. Then, using the new data provided by the user, I updated the corresponding property of the user object.
